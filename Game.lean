Title "Discrete Mathematics with Lean4"
Introduction
"
Welcome to **Discrete Math with Lean4**, a fun and interactive game that will help you in proving several theorems **MH1812 - Discrete Mathematics**

There are several levels that you can try out in each world. Each level essentially covers a theorem taught in the lecture. And you have many such levels queued up in a world.
Start by clicking on **Propositional** on the right.
