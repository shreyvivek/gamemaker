Title "Exercises - Propositional"

Introduction "
In this world, you'll try out some exercises on propositional logic, based on the knowledge gained so far.

Before you start, take note of the panel on the right (if you are on PC). You can find the documentations/descriptions for several **Tactics** we will be making use of, and **Theorems** we will be proving(_and using_) in this World. Click on them, whether locked or unlocked, to read and understand! You are encouraged to do so whenever you are prompted to use a tactic in the game.
