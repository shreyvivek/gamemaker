Title "What’s a Predicate?"

Introduction "
Welcome to **Predicate Logic**!

In propositional logic, you worked with full statements like `3 > 2`.
In predicate logic, we work with **statements that depend on a variable**.

These are called **predicates**.

For instance:
> Let `P(x)` mean “x is a student”.

This is not a full proposition until we plug in a value like `P(alice)`.

In Lean, we write this as:
```lean
P : α → Prop
```
Let’s see how to use one!

Purpose: Use the apply tactic to specialize a universally quantified statement.

You are given:

`h : ∀ x, P x → Q x`

`hP : P a`

To prove `Q a`, you apply `h a`, which gives `P a → Q a`, and then use `hP`.

Statement predicate_intro {α : Type} (P Q : α → Prop) (a : α) (h : ∀ x, P (x) → Q (x)) (hP : P (a)) : Q (a) := by
Hint "You want to prove `Q (a)`, and you have a rule: `∀ x, P (x) → Q (x)`.

Apply that rule at the specific value `a`."
apply h (a)
Hint "Now Lean wants you to prove `P (a)`, which you already have from `hP`."
exact hP

Conclusion "
Nice work! 🎉

You just used a predicate rule to prove a specific case.

This is the core idea of predicate logic:
General statements like `∀ x, P (x) → Q (x)` can be instantiated at a specific value.

And Lean handles it just like functions!
