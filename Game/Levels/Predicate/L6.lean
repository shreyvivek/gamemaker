Title "Existential Before Universal"

Introduction "
Letâ€™s look at **another nesting** of quantifiers â€” this time:

> \"There exists an `x` such that for every `y`, `P(x, y)` holds.\"

This is written:
```lean
âˆƒ x, âˆ€ y, P(x, y)
```
This means there is one special `x` that works for all `y`.

So to prove a particular P(a, b), itâ€™s enough to:
- Pull out that special `x`
- Apply the universal rule for `y = b`

Weâ€™ll use a combination of `intro` and `exact`.

Statement {Î± : Type} (P : Î± â†’ Î± â†’ Prop) (a : Î±) (h : âˆƒ x, âˆ€ y, P x y) : âˆ€ y, P a y â†’ âˆƒ x, P x y := by
Hint "You want to prove a universal statement: `âˆ€ y, P a y â†’ âˆƒ x, P x y.`

This means we should assume an arbitrary value of `y`, and a hypothesis that `P a y` holds.

Use the intro tactic twice to bring them into the context : `intro y hy`"
intro y hy
Hint "Now your goal is: `âˆƒ x, P x y`.

You already have a proof of `P a y` (it's called `hy`).

To prove that there exists such an `x`, itâ€™s enough to give a specific example â€” and you know that `a` works!

Use the existential introduction syntax to finish off (with `exact`)."
exact âŸ¨a, hyâŸ©

Conclusion "
Awesome! ðŸŽ‰

You just worked through a nested quantifier goal â€” in the reverse direction from before.

From:
```lean
P a y
```
you concluded:
```lean
âˆƒ x, P x y
```
This is called **existential introduction** â€” and you used the value `a` as your witness.

Pay attention to the order of quantifiers:

`âˆ€ x, âˆƒ y` means each `x` may have its own `y`

`âˆƒ x, âˆ€ y` means one single `x` works for every `y`

These are not logically equivalent â€” and you now understand how to prove statements from both.
