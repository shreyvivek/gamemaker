Title "Set Membership"

Introduction "
Welcome to the world of **Set Theory**! ðŸ§º

Sets are collections of objects. We write `x âˆˆ A` to say that *element x is in set A*.

This level introduces one of the most fundamental ideas: **membership**.

In Lean, we work with `x âˆˆ A` as a proposition, which we can use in proofs.

Letâ€™s prove something simple!

Purpose: Use the `exact` tactic when your goal matches something you already know.

Youâ€™re given:
- A set `A : Set â„•`
- An element `x : â„•`
- A hypothesis `h : x âˆˆ A`

And your goal is to prove exactly that: `x âˆˆ A`.

Since your goal *already matches* your assumption, just use:
`exact h`

This is the most basic kind of step in a proof: confirming something youâ€™ve already assumed.

Statement (A : Set â„•) (x : â„•) (h : x âˆˆ A) : x âˆˆ A := by
  Hint "You are trying to prove `x âˆˆ A`. And you already have `h : x âˆˆ A`.

Just use `exact h` to complete the proof."
  exact h



Conclusion "
Great start! âœ…

Youâ€™ve just used a given assumption to complete a proof.

Set membership (`x âˆˆ A`) is one of the most basic ideas in math â€” and youâ€™ll use it a lot in upcoming levels.
