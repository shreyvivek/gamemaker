Introduction "
In this world, you'll explore the foundations of Sets.

Each level presents a new fundamental theorem or principle.

Before you start, take note of the panel on the right (if you are on PC). You can find the documentations/descriptions for several **Tactics** we will be making use of, and **Theorems** we will be proving(_and using_) in this World. Click on them, whether locked or unlocked, to read and understand! You are encouraged to do so whenever you are prompted to use a tactic in the game.
