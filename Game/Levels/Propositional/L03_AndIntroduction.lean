Title "And Introduction"

Introduction "
From `P` and `Q`, we can conclude `P ∧ Q`. That’s how conjunction works!

You’ll learn the `constructor` tactic in this level.

Purpose: Use exact when you already have a proof of exactly what the goal is asking for.

It closes the goal immediately if the term matches the goal’s type.

📌 Think of it as:

“Here's exactly what you're asking for — done!”

If your goal is `P` and you have a proof of `P` (say `h : P`), then `exact h` completes the proof.

To summarize:

You have : `h : P`
Your goal : `P`
`exact h` will complete the proof!

Purpose: Use intro to assume something — usually when proving an implication.

If your goal is `P → Q`, `intro h` changes the goal to `Q` and gives you `h : P` as a local assumption.

📌 Think of it as:

“Let me assume `P` is true for now, and see if I can prove `Q`.”
Opens up an implication goal by introducing its assumption.

To summarize:

Your goal : `h : P → P`
After `intro h`,
you get an assumption `h : P` and your goal will just be `P`.

/--
Used when the goal is a compound proposition like `P ∧ Q`.

It splits the goal into proving both components separately.

For example: `constructor` on `P ∧ Q` gives you two goals — one for `P` and one for `Q`.
