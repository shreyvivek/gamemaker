Title "And Introduction"

Introduction "
From `P` and `Q`, we can conclude `P ‚àß Q`. That‚Äôs how conjunction works!

You‚Äôll learn the `constructor` tactic in this level.
"

/--
Purpose: Use constructor when your goal is a conjunction (`P ‚àß Q`).

It splits the goal into two subgoals: one for `P`, and one for `Q`.

üìå Think of it as:

‚ÄúTo prove both `P` and `Q`, let‚Äôs do them one at a time.‚Äù

To summarize:
`constructor` on `P ‚àß Q` gives you two sub goals ‚Äî one for `P` and one for `Q`.

  Hint "Firstly, prove `P` using `{hp}` in the `Active Goal` to proceed to `Goal 2`

  Then, in `Goal 2`, prove `Q` using `{hq}`."

Nice work! You combined two truths into one solid conjunction.
