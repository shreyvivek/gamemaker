Title "And Introduction"

Introduction "
From `P` and `Q`, we can conclude `P ‚àß Q`. That‚Äôs how conjunction works!

You‚Äôll learn the `constructor` tactic in this level.

/--
Purpose: Use exact when you already have a proof of exactly what the goal is asking for.

It closes the goal immediately if the term matches the goal‚Äôs type.

üìå Think of it as:

‚ÄúHere's exactly what you're asking for ‚Äî done!‚Äù

If your goal is `P` and you have a proof of `P` (say `h : P`), then `exact h` completes the proof.

To summarize:

You have : `h : P`
Your goal : `P`
`exact h` will complete the proof!

/--
Used when the goal is a compound proposition like `P ‚àß Q`.

It splits the goal into proving both components separately.

For example: `constructor` on `P ‚àß Q` gives you two goals ‚Äî one for `P` and one for `Q`.
