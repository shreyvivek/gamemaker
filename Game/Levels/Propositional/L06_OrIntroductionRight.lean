Introduction "
If `Q` is true, then `P ‚à® Q` is also true ‚Äî because *at least one* must hold.

Now let‚Äôs learn how to use the `right` tactic.
"

/--
---

Purpose: Use `right` when your goal is a disjunction (`P ‚à® Q`) and you want to prove the **right** part.

If your goal is `P ‚à® Q`, then `right` changes the goal to proving `Q`.

üìå Think of it as:

‚ÄúI‚Äôll prove the second part of the `or`, and that‚Äôs good enough.‚Äù

---

### In Propositional Logic:

Your goal : `P ‚à® Q`

After `right`, your new goal is just `Q`.

---

### In Sets:

Your goal : `x ‚àà A ‚à™ B`

After `right`, your new goal is just `x ‚àà B`.

Conclusion "
Great! You've now mastered both `left` and `right` tactics, and how they can be useful in a disjunction.
