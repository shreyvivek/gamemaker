Title "Or Introduction (Right)"

Introduction "
If `Q` is true, then `P ‚à® Q` is also true ‚Äî because *at least one* must hold.

Now let‚Äôs learn how to use the `right` tactic.
"

/--
Purpose: Use `right` when your goal is a disjunction (`P ‚à® Q`) and you want to prove the **right** part.

If your goal is `P ‚à® Q`, then `right` changes the goal to proving `Q`.

üìå Think of it as:

‚ÄúI‚Äôll prove the second part of the `or`, and that‚Äôs good enough.‚Äù

To summarize:

Your goal : `P ‚à® Q`
After `right`, your new goal is just `Q`

Conclusion "
Great! You've now mastered both `left` and `right` tactics, and how they can be useful in a disjunction.
