Introduction "
If `Q` is true, then `P ‚à® Q` is also true ‚Äî because *at least one* must hold.

Now let‚Äôs learn how to use the `right` tactic.
"
/--
Purpose: Use exact when you already have a proof of exactly what the goal is asking for.

It closes the goal immediately if the term matches the goal‚Äôs type.

üìå Think of it as:

‚ÄúHere's exactly what you're asking for ‚Äî done!‚Äù

If your goal is `P` and you have a proof of `P` (say `h : P`), then `exact h` completes the proof.

To summarize:

You have : `h : P`
Your goal : `P`
`exact h` will complete the proof!

/-- Repeated for clarity.

For disjunctions (`P ‚à® Q`):

- `left` means: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll prove `P`, and that‚Äôs enough.‚Äù
- `right` means: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll prove `Q`, and that‚Äôs enough.‚Äù

Use `left` when you have a proof of `P`, and `right` when you have a proof of `Q`.
