Title "Implication Chain"

Introduction "
Suppose you know two implications:

- If `P`, then `Q`. (i.e., `P ‚Üí Q`)
- If `Q`, then `R`. (i.e., `Q ‚Üí R`)

Then it logically follows that `P ‚Üí R`.

Let‚Äôs practice chaining these implications directly.

**Note:** This level can be solved like the previous one, but it can also be done using a new tactic. Follow the hints accordingly.

Purpose: Use exact when you already have a proof of exactly what the goal is asking for.

It closes the goal immediately if the term matches the goal‚Äôs type.

üìå Think of it as:

‚ÄúHere's exactly what you're asking for ‚Äî done!‚Äù

If your goal is `P` and you have a proof of `P` (say `h : P`), then `exact h` completes the proof.

To summarize:

You have : `h : P`
Your goal : `P`
`exact h` will complete the proof!

TacticDoc exact

/--
The `intro` tactic assumes the premise of an implication.

Then you can either:
- Use `apply` with a function, or
- Call implication functions directly (e.g., `exact h‚ÇÇ (h‚ÇÅ hp)`).

TacticDoc intro

/--
Solves the current goal by using a function or theorem.

If your goal is `Q` and you have `P ‚Üí Q`, then `apply` turns the goal into proving `P`.
It's like saying: ‚ÄúTo prove `Q`, it's enough to prove `P`.‚Äù
