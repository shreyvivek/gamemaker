Title "And Elimination (Left)"

Introduction "
If you know `P ∧ Q`, then you can extract `P` from it.

We’ll use the `exact` tactic, combined with `.left`, described further below.
"
/--
Purpose: Use exact when you already have a proof of exactly what the goal is asking for.

It closes the goal immediately if the term matches the goal’s type.

📌 Think of it as:

“Here's exactly what you're asking for — done!”

If your goal is `P` and you have a proof of `P` (say `h : P`), then `exact h` completes the proof.

To summarize:

You have : `h : P`
Your goal : `P`
`exact h` will complete the proof!

/--
Purpose: Use intro to assume something — usually when proving an implication.

If your goal is `P → Q`, `intro h` changes the goal to `Q` and gives you `h : P` as a local assumption.

📌 Think of it as:

“Let me assume `P` is true for now, and see if I can prove `Q`.”
Opens up an implication goal by introducing its assumption.

To summarize:

Your goal : `h : P → P`
After `intro h`,
you get an assumption `h : P` and your goal will just be `P`.

/--
Purpose: Use constructor when your goal is a conjunction (`P ∧ Q`).

It splits the goal into two subgoals: one for `P`, and one for `Q`.

📌 Think of it as:

“To prove both `P` and `Q`, let’s do them one at a time.”

To summarize:
`constructor` on `P ∧ Q` gives you two sub goals — one for `P` and one for `Q`.

  Hint "As you know, the `exact` tactic finishes the goal using a term that exactly matches the target.

  If you have `h : P ∧ Q`, then:
  - `h.left` gives you a term of type `P`
  - `h.right` gives you a term of type `Q`

  These are not tactics, but useful expressions to pass to `exact`.

  Now you know what to do to extract the left part `P` from `P ∧ Q`."

Conclusion "
Nicely done! You extracted the left side of a conjunction. A similar procedure can be followed to extract the right half of a conjunction.
