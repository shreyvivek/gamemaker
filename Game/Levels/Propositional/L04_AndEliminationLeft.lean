Title "And Elimination (Left)"

Introduction "
If you know `P ‚àß Q`, then you can extract `P` from it.

Let‚Äôs see how to do that with `.left`.

Purpose: Use exact when you already have a proof of exactly what the goal is asking for.

It closes the goal immediately if the term matches the goal‚Äôs type.

üìå Think of it as:

‚ÄúHere's exactly what you're asking for ‚Äî done!‚Äù

If your goal is `P` and you have a proof of `P` (say `h : P`), then `exact h` completes the proof.

To summarize:

You have : `h : P`
Your goal : `P`
`exact h` will complete the proof!

Purpose: Use intro to assume something ‚Äî usually when proving an implication.

If your goal is `P ‚Üí Q`, `intro h` changes the goal to `Q` and gives you `h : P` as a local assumption.

üìå Think of it as:

‚ÄúLet me assume `P` is true for now, and see if I can prove `Q`.‚Äù
Opens up an implication goal by introducing its assumption.

To summarize:

Your goal : `h : P ‚Üí P`
After `intro h`,
you get an assumption `h : P` and your goal will just be `P`.

Purpose: Use constructor when your goal is a conjunction (`P ‚àß Q`).

It splits the goal into two subgoals: one for `P`, and one for `Q`.

üìå Think of it as:

‚ÄúTo prove both `P` and `Q`, let‚Äôs do them one at a time.‚Äù

To summarize:
`constructor` on `P ‚àß Q` gives you two sub goals ‚Äî one for `P` and one for `Q`.

If you have `h : P ‚àß Q`, then:

- `h.left` gives you a proof of `P`.
- `h.right` gives you a proof of `Q`.

They‚Äôre used to ‚Äúunpack‚Äù conjunctions.

Conclusion "
Nicely done! You extracted the left side of a conjunction. A similar procedure can be followed to extract the right half of a conjunction.
