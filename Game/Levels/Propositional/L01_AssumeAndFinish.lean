Title "Assume and Finish"

Introduction "
Welcome!

Let‚Äôs begin with the simplest task. Let `P` be a proposition.

```
P: It is raining.
```
If you're told `P` is true, then you can conclude `P`.
That's like - you already know it is raining. So you can also make the conclusion, that it is raining.

Sounds trivial, but this teaches you how to use assumptions to finish a goal.

Purpose: Use exact when you already have a proof of exactly what the goal is asking for.

It closes the goal immediately if the term matches the goal‚Äôs type.

üìå Think of it as:

‚ÄúHere's exactly what you're asking for ‚Äî done!‚Äù

### In Propositional Logic:

If your goal is `P` and you have a proof of `P` (say `h : P`), then `exact h` completes the proof.

To summarize:

You have : `h : P`
Your goal : `P`
`exact h` will complete the proof!

### In Predicate Logic:

You‚Äôre given:
- `P : ‚Ñï ‚Üí Prop`
- `x : ‚Ñï`
- `h : P x`

And your goal is to prove exactly that: `P x`.

You already have the fact `P x` as `h`, and your goal is exactly `P x`.
So you can finish the proof directly with `exact h`.

### In Sets:

You‚Äôre given:

- A set `A : Set ‚Ñï`
- An element `x : ‚Ñï`
- A hypothesis `h : x ‚àà A`

And your goal is to prove exactly that: `x ‚àà A`.

Since your goal *already matches* your assumption, just use:

`exact h`

This is the most basic kind of step in a proof: confirming something you‚Äôve already assumed.
