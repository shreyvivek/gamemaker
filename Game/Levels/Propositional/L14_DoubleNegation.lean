Title "Implication Application"

Introduction
"
This level introduces the idea that an implication `P → Q` is just like a function:
if you know `P`, and you have a way to go from `P` to `Q`, then you can apply it.

In Lean, this means using `exact h hp`, where `h : P → Q` and `hp : P`.

Simple and satisfying!

/--
Purpose: Use exact when you already have a proof of exactly what the goal is asking for.

It closes the goal immediately if the term matches the goal’s type.

📌 Think of it as:

“Here's exactly what you're asking for — done!”

If your goal is `P` and you have a proof of `P` (say `h : P`), then `exact h` completes the proof.

To summarize:

You have : `h : P`
Your goal : `P`
`exact h` will complete the proof!

/--
Purpose: Use intro to assume something — usually when proving an implication.

If your goal is `P → Q`, `intro h` changes the goal to `Q` and gives you `h : P` as a local assumption.

📌 Think of it as:

“Let me assume `P` is true for now, and see if I can prove `Q`.”
Opens up an implication goal by introducing its assumption.

To summarize:

Your goal : `h : P → P`
After `intro h`,
you get an assumption `h : P` and your goal will just be `P`.

Conclusion
"
Nice! You just applied a function — that's really all an implication is.

`P → Q` is the same as saying: “If I have `P`, I can give you `Q`.”

You’ll see this pattern come up a lot in proofs.
