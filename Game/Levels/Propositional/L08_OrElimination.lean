Title "Or Elimination"

Introduction "
You might remember one such proof from lectures — **Dilemma**.

---

**Given:**
- (1) `P ∨ Q`
- (2) `P → R`
- (3) `Q → R`

**To Prove:** `R`

---

**Proof (in natural language):**

We use disjunction elimination on `P ∨ Q`, i.e., we consider both cases separately:

- *Case 1:* Assume `P` is true.
  From (2), `P → R`, so `R` is true.

- *Case 2:* Assume `Q` is true.
  From (3), `Q → R`, so again `R` is true.

In both cases, `R` is true.

So regardless of whether `P` or `Q` is true, we conclude:

**`R` is true.**

Purpose: Use `cases` on a disjunction (e.g. `P ∨ Q`) to split it into two separate cases.

Each case creates a new assumption:
- `inl hp` means `P` is assumed true
- `inr hq` means `Q` is assumed true

📌 Think of it as:

“Let’s examine both possible scenarios and show that the goal works either way.”

To summarize:

Given: `h : P ∨ Q`
After:
- Case 1: `hp : P`
- Case 2: `hq : Q`

    Hint "
In this case, `P` holds (`h : P`) and you also have `hpr : P → R`.

This matches the **Modus Ponens** pattern: if `P` is true and `P → R`, then `R` must be true.

Use the `exact` tactic to apply the implication, with `modus_ponens` like this : `exact modus_ponens hpr h`.

This tells Lean to use modus_ponens on `hpr` and `h₁`, resulting in `R`.

Do similarly for when `Q` is assumed to be true in `Goal 2`.

Conclusion "
You’ve completed a textbook disjunction elimination! You can also see how versatile the `exact` tactic is.

By showing the goal holds in **both** branches of the `or`, you’ve logically proven it no matter what.
