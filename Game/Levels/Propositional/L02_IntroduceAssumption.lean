Title "Introduce Assumption"

Introduction "
Let‚Äôs prove an implication: `P ‚Üí P`. That is, if `P` holds, then `P` holds (trivially).

This level introduces the `intro` tactic.
"

/--
Purpose: Use intro to assume something ‚Äî usually when proving an implication.

If your goal is `P ‚Üí Q`, `intro h` changes the goal to `Q` and gives you `h : P` as a local assumption.

üìå Think of it as:

‚ÄúLet me assume `P` is true for now, and see if I can prove `Q`.‚Äù
Opens up an implication goal by introducing its assumption.

To summarize:

Your goal : `h : P ‚Üí P`
After `intro h`,
you get an assumption `h : P` and your goal will just be `P`.

  Hint "Use the `intro` tactic to assume `P` is true. Try `intro h`."
  intro h
  Hint "Now you have `{h} : P`, and your goal is `P`. Use `exact` to finish."

Conclusion "
That was a basic implication! The `intro` tactic is your go-to tool for these.
