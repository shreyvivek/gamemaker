Title "Mathematical Induction"

Introduction "
Welcome to the world of **Induction**!

Mathematical Induction is a powerful proof technique used to show that a statement holds for all natural numbers.

The basic structure of an induction proof involves:
1. **Base Case**: Show that the statement holds for the first natural number (usually 0 or 1).
2. **Inductive Step**: Assume it holds for an arbitrary `n`, and then prove it for `n + 1`.

You'll begin with some classic induction formulas to get comfortable with the structure and reasoning process.
